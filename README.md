# Sortinng Algorithms

In this project the following sorting algoriths are implemented in C
- [Bubble sort]()
- [Insertion sort]()
- [Selection sort]()
- [Quick sort]()

## Bubble Sort

A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through
the input list element by element comparing the current element with
the one after it and swapping them if needed. The list becomes fully 
sorted when there are no more swaps to be performed.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort repeatedly consumes one input element and finds the location
it belongs to in the sorted list and inserts it there. It does this till no 
input element remains.

## Selection Sort

Selection sort divides the input list into two parts, sublist of items 
which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and 
a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
The sorted sublist is initially empty and is repeatedly populated by the
least item (if sorted in an ascending order) from the unsorted sublist.

## Quick sort

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot'
element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two 
sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than 
the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
